# Tensorflow-PLC-Image-Classification
This repository hosts TensorFlow-based image classification code tailored for Special Purpose Machines (SPM) used in pickup and place tasks. The system interfaces with a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) through OPC Unified Architecture (OPCUA) communication for seamless integration into industrial environments.
